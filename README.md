## Vegan Glasgow ##
I love food. So as a vegetarian with a dairy allergy I’m an enforced vegan and am always on the look out for restaurant recommendations in my local area that can cater to my dietary requirements. I’ll be honest, when dining out vegetarian options can be limited - we’ve all been served a mushy risotto or, my hands down worst meal, a plate of boiled cauliflower and potatoes (which the restaurant charged £10 for).

These personal experiences inspired me to create (insert name here), for locals and visitors to my home city of Glasgow, to share their experiences and help take the guess work out of finding a great vegan meal.

### GOALS ###
#### VISITOR GOALS ####
Target audience:

- Vegans, vegetarians or people who would like to eat a more plant-based diet. - Self-proclaimed ‘foodies’.
- People who live in the Glasgow area.
- People who are visiting Glasgow or are planning a trip to the city.

#### USER GOALS ####
- Have somewhere to search for restaurant recommendations. - Explore the amazing food scene of the city of Glasgow.
- Be able to leave reviews for other users to help them.

Specific user goals:

- Find recommendations on menu items.
- Find information on the Type of food served ie/ Italian, Traditional Scottish, Japanese, Fusion. - Find out whether the kitchen is purely vegan.
- Find out whether there is a full vegan menu or only a few options.
- Find out whether vegan alcoholic drinks are available.
- Find whether the restaurant is family friendly.
- Find out the price range.
- Find out whether vegan options are offered across 3 courses, as vegan desserts can be rare. - Find out the restaurant style ie/ fast food, casual, formal.
- Find the area of the city the restaurant is located.
- Find out whether large groups be catered for.
- Will I find meat options for my meat eating friends and family.
- Find information on restaurants options close to me.
- Be able to leave recommendations for others.
- Be able to Edit my reviews if my opinions change.

Why does Vegan Glasgow meet these user needs:

- As an enforced vegan dining out can be stressful so I spend a lot of time searching for
restaurant menu’s and possible food options so have a good understanding of potential users
needs.
- The design of the site is clear and accessbile and information is laid out in a user friendly way.
- The site allows visitors to leave reviews meaning experiences are continuously updated and
remain relevant.

#### WEBSITE GOALS ####
- A user friendly site that allows foodies to quickly find recommendations of places to eat based on their tystes.
- An opportunity for the developer to further develop their frontend programming skills using HTML CSS Bootstrap and JavaScript.
- An opportunity for the developer to practice their new found backend programming skills using Python, MongoDB, Flask and Jinja.

### DESIGN CHOICES ### 
#### FONTS ####

Lobster - All Logos, titles, subtitles and headers.
*insert example image*

Muli - Font used for all other text items.
*insert example image*

#### ICONS ####
Thanks to Font Awesome the website utilises lots of icons to make the large amount of information available quick to identify and absord:
Plus sign = Add an item
Trash can = Delete an item
Pencil = Edit an item
Location marker = address
Telephone = contact number
Cheese = dairy options Meat(drumstick) = Meat options

#### COLOR ####
After researching colors, shades of green were selected to suggest nature, freshness and safety.  Green is synonomous with veganism and, of course, we always want our food to be fresh.  Finally, the origins of the name 'Glasgow' are widely believed to be 'green hollow' or (dear)'green place'.
