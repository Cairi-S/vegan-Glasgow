![Vegan Glasgow Site Mockup](/static/images/readme/vg-mockup.png)

*TOC here*

I love food. So as a vegetarian with a dairy allergy I’m an enforced vegan and am always on the look out for restaurant recommendations in my local area that can cater to my dietary requirements. I’ll be honest, when dining out vegetarian options can be limited - we’ve all been served a mushy risotto or, my hands down worst meal, a plate of boiled cauliflower and potatoes (which the restaurant charged £10 for).

These personal experiences inspired me to create *Vegan Glasgow*, for locals and visitors to my home city of Glasgow, to share their experiences and help take the guess work out of finding a great vegan meal.

### GOALS ###
#### VISITOR GOALS ####
Target audience:

- Vegans, vegetarians or people who would like to eat a more plant-based diet. 
- Self-proclaimed ‘foodies’.
- People who live in the Glasgow area.
- People who are visiting Glasgow or are planning a trip to the city.

#### USER GOALS ####
- Have somewhere to search for restaurant recommendations. 
- Explore the amazing food scene of the city of Glasgow.
- Be able to leave reviews for other users to help them.

Specific user goals:

- Find out contact information for individual restaurants.
- Find exteral links to restaurants homepages and social media where appropriate.
- See attractive images of the restaurant so I can judge whether I might enjoy the food and atmosphere.
- Find information on the cuisine ie/ Italian, Traditional Scottish, Japanese, Fusion.
- Find out the price range.
- Find what mealtimes restaurants are open.
- Be able to create an account and have an individual profile.
- Be able to leave reviews to help advise others.
- Be able to Edit my reviews if my opinions change.
- Be able to add restaurants to the website if I find somewhere which is not already listed.

Why does Vegan Glasgow meet these user needs:

- As an enforced vegan dining out can be stressful so I spend a lot of time searching for
restaurant menu’s and possible food options so have a good understanding of potential users
needs.
- The design of the site is clear and accessbile and information is laid out in a user friendly way.
- The site allows visitors to leave reviews meaning experiences are continuously updated and
remain relevant.
- The website features the designers own favourite recommendations. In future this would be changed to an average of the users rating.

### BUSINESS STORIES ###
Vegan Glasgow is currently only for private recommendations, however there could be future scope to monetise the site and would be a future feature.

If this were the case the target businesses for Vegan Glasgow would be:

- Vegan restaurants in the area.
- Restaurants wanting to reach a wider audience.
- Restaurants advertising that they are fully vegan or have transitioned to fully vegan.
- Restaurants advertising the vegan options on their menu

Business user goals would be:

- A well designed website which is easy for the public to navigate that will benefit my business to be a part of.
- A design that allows me to input and update my own restaurants data easily and efficiently.
- Value for money.

#### WEBSITE GOALS ####
- A user friendly site that allows foodies to quickly find recommendations of places to eat based on their tastes.
- An opportunity for the developer to further develop their frontend programming skills using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
- An opportunity for the developer to practice their new found backend programming skills using Python, MongoDB, Flask and Jinja.

### USER STORIES ### 
Visitor Stories:

As a visitor to Vegan Glasgow I would like:

- To find menu item recommendations quickly and easily.
- To quickly see what type of food is served so I can choose a restaurant based on my tastes. 
- To find restaurants that are purely vegan so I know whether my meal may come into contact with
dairy and/or meat products in the kitchen.
- To know whether I will be able to purchase drinks (both soft and alcoholic) that also cater to my
dietary choices.
- To have quick access to price points so I know that I will be dining out within my budget.
- To know where I can grab a ‘cheap and cheerful’ bite to eat while maintaining my dietary
choices.
- To know where I can dine out locally when I am too tired to cook a meal at home.
- To quickly find restaurants close to the area of the city I am exploring when hunger hits. 
- To find restaurants that can also cater for my friends who choose to eat meat and dairy as I
appreciate a plant-based lifestyle is my choice but is not for everyone.
- To find rough mealtimes of restaurants so I know what will be open when I am looking to dine.
- To be able to find cafe options as well as restaurants for those times I just want coffee and a cake.
- To be able to express my thoughts on a restaurant and it’s menu.
- To be able to change my mind and update an earlier review if I return to a restaurant and the
service and quality of food has changed.
- To be able to contact the site about exciting new restaurants I have discovered.

### BUSINESS STORIES ###

If Vegan Glasgow were to be monetised, businesses may want to:
- Quickly and clearly see information about competitors.
- See that the various methods of contacting my restaurant are clearly displayed.
- Have the ability to edit my own restaurants page to keep all information up to date.
- Use forms to quickly and efficiently log information.
- Be able to advertise special offers and deals.

### DESIGN CHOICES ### 
#### FONTS ####
All chosen fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=Vegan%20Glasgow&preview.text_type=custom)

[Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster?preview.text=Vegan%20Glasgow&preview.text_type=custom)
- All Logos, titles, subtitles and headers.
![Google Fonts - Lobster](/static/images/readme/Lobster.png)

[Mulish](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish?query=muli&preview.text=Vegan%20Glasgow&preview.text_type=custom)
- Font used for all other text items.
![Google Fonts - Mulish](/static/images/readme/Mullish.png)

#### ICONS ####
Thanks to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), the website utilises lots of icons to make a large amount of information is quickly identifiable and easy to absorb:

e.g/
- Plus sign = Add an item
- Trash can = Delete an item
- Pencil = Edit an item
- Location marker = address
- Telephone = contact number
- Cheese = dairy options Meat(drumstick) = Meat options

#### COLOR ####
After researching color theory, shades of green were selected to suggest nature, freshness and safety.  

Green is synonomous with veganism and, of course, we always want our food to be fresh.  Finally, the origins of the name 'Glasgow' are widely believed to be 'green hollow' or (dear)'green place'.

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and [Color Tool Material Design](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0&primary.color=560027&secondary.color=E0E0E0) were used to select the color palette.

![Coolors color palette](/static/images/readme/color-palette.png)

1. Navbar, footer, internal sub-headings: #629490. 
- A green evoking natural and freshness.
2. Main Background: White.
- Providing contrast and depth.
3. Cards and navbar/footer text: #e0e0e0. 
- Providing depth and clearly sections information areas. 
4. Card text and borders: #243119.
- Clearly stands out against all other colors used.

Buttons use the easily identifiable traffic light system:
- Positive actions (e.g. submit) - Green 
- Negative actions (e.g. cancel) - Red
- Editing actions - Amber
